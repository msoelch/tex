# tex
This repository provides convenient and readable macros for commonly used syntax when writing scientific articles about machine learning.
The documentation can be found in `example.tex` and `example.pdf`, respectively.

### Planned extensions
- Overload `\gauss` for conditional Gaussians.
- Allow TeXstudio autocomplete even for dynamically created macros (e.g., via script).
